		<h1>Texas Holdem Project (C#)</h1>
		<div class="image-container-small" id = "texasholdem2"></div>
		<p>
		This was a fun project to make. I learned a lot about object orientated design and as well as pair programming and test driven development. The project was designed with Jaden Chen. It contains with a class library. We wrote test programs for poker hands, betting and AI functionality. The UI was very fun to design and we felt it is good enough to be professional.
		</p>
		<p>
		I hope to revisit this project in the future. Potential enhancements include improving AI with Machine Learning, allow for multi-player through servers and migration to android/IOS application.

		<h1>Massive Online Open Course (MOOC)</h1>
		<div id = "mooc2"></div>
		<p>I was introduced to MOOC at a presentation of one of our engineering meetings in my second coop term at Genesys. It completely changed the way about how I perceive education and its value. Here my opinions on why all college students should take at least one online course.
		</p>
		<h3><i>So what is MOOC and why is it so great?</i></h3>
		<p>MOOC stands for Massive Open Online Courses. It is an education system that emphasizes unlimited access and open access. </p>
		<p>Main perks of MOOCs:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Completely FREE (that’s right, you don’t have to pay a cent for free knowledge)</p></li>
			<li><p>Accessibility (it is completely open to the world, you get to meet and interact with people from all continents, it can be a great tool for networking)</p></li>
			<li><p>Quality of Education (courses are offered by the best universities in the world – Stanford, MIT, UFT)</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>A main function of the web as a medium is to share knowledge openly and freely and I believe that MOOC’s is a great tool to realize that goal. Besides, getting knowledge for free is a win-win situation.</p>
		<h2>My MOOC courses</h2>
		<p>I started taking MOOC courses from Jan 2015. Rather than talk about my college courses, I will try to reflect on all the online courses I have taken. Hopefully this will give you a better perspective on these courses and encourage you try them out.</p>

		<p>Machine Learning is a very popular course offered every 4 months at Coursera. It is offered by Stanford University. I was very fortunate to be taught by the founder of Coursera, Andrew Ng. Overall, I found the course to be well structured and informative. Prof Andrew Ng does a great job of communicating difficult concepts in a concise and easy to understand manner.</p>
		<p>The course consist of weekly series of lecture videos and review questions for each set of lecture videos. In addition, there are weekly programming exercises where you get to apply what you learned to a real machine learning problem. Examples include a spam classifier and handwriting detector. </p>
		<p>While these assignments are cool, all of the assignments already have boilerplate code written for you and you only have to implement a small part of the code. I wish the assignments will force you implement more of the code to reinforce the concepts more.</p>
		<p>Topics covered include supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks and SVMs and unsupervised learning such as K-Means, and anomaly detection. It also goes through methods of debugging your algorithm and practical applications such as recommender systems and photo OCR. </p>
		<p>The course draws upon many concepts from math subjects such as Linear Algebra, Calculus and Statistics. While they are not required to succeed in this course, those with a good mathematical foundation will have a deeper understanding of the material.</p>
		<p>Personally, not only did I learn many useful material from this course but it also sparked my interest data science and artificial intelligence. This course taught me that self-driving cars, speech recognition and genome analysis is not as hard as previously thought with the right tools. I am very optimistic about AI researching going forward and I hope I can make a contribution to this field in the future. (Fingers crossed).</p>
